# discogs-api-swagger-file
A swagger file for the [discogs API](https://www.discogs.com/developers).

For the moment only two methods are provided:

- [GET /artists/{artist_id}](https://www.discogs.com/developers#page:database,header:database-artist)
- [GET /releases/{release_id}/rating/{username}](https://www.discogs.com/developers#page:database,header:database-release-rating-by-user)

Feel free to add more.
